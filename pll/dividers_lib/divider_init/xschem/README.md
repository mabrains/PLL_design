Fractional-N divider has a significant role in our proposed PLL.
It is responsible for setting the value of output frequency which is the carrier frequency of the transceiver.
Fractionality in modulus value is a result of MMD & DSM integration. 
In this section, MMD (Multi Modulus Divider) is designed and simulated.

##The design process is in progress.
