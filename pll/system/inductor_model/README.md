Inductor Pi Model Simple Calculator
=================

- Here is a simple calculator implemented in python that calculates the parameters of the Pi model for an inductor.
- The calculation of the parameters are dependent on the value of the inductance required, the operating center frequency, and the desired quality factor from this inductor.
- The values of the capacitances in the model are roughly estimated from the stack of Skywater 130nm PDK.
