# _Status of the python Models_
![80%](https://progress-bar.dev/80/?title=completed)

* Need to model the loop filter parameters calculator

* Python models are compiled and are working probably but there is a catch in the figures that I seem to have missed

* Some figures are outputted correctly and some are not.
  
Here are the samples

![1st_sample](images/1st_sample_images/4.png)
![1st_sample](images/1st_sample_images/5.png)
![1st_sample](images/1st_sample_images/6.png)
![1st_sample](images/1st_sample_images/7.png)

As clearly shwon in the images some figures are not correct for some reasons.
